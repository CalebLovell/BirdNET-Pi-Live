// The Timeline page as one block of pasteable text, the period-scoped
// counterpart to share-card.ts. Where that card summarises a day, this one
// summarises whichever window the switcher is showing -- a day, a week, a
// month, a year or the whole station -- and the sparkline is the page's own
// subject: the shape of the day, hour by hour, across that window.
//
// Pure by design: every figure comes from the rows the page already has, so
// sharing costs no extra round trip.
