				    `fixed inset-0` rather than a `h-dvh` block in flow: anything else
				    on the page that pokes below the fold (such as a portalled overlay)
				    can still make the document scrollable, and a
				    shell in flow would ride along with it. Pinned, it cannot move.

				    `min-h-0` on the content column is the part that makes it work:
				    a flex child's default `min-height: auto` refuses to shrink below
				    its content, so without it the column grows past the viewport and
				    the overflow escapes to the window again.

				    `min-w-0` stops a wide table or a long species name from forcing
				    the whole row wider than the viewport and squeezing the sidebar. */}
