/**
 * The desktop sidebar: a card in the same family as the page's content cards,
 * inset from the viewport so paper shows to its left and above and below it.
 *
 * Nothing sticky or fixed here: the shell in `__root` is a single non-scrolling
 * viewport, so the column simply sits in normal flow at full height and stays
 * put while the content pane scrolls beside it. That also means the main column
 * needs no matching left offset, so the two can never disagree about width.
 *
 * The inset lives on the `aside` and the scrolling on the card inside it: a
 * single element can't both be the full-height box and the padded card without
 * the padding scrolling away with the content. `h-full` then makes the card
 * exactly a viewport minus the inset, so the station block stays reachable on a
 * short window.
